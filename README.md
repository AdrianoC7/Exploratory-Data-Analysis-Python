# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Introduction
# Business Context. The city of New York has seen a rise in the number of accidents on the roads in the city. They would like to know if the number of accidents have increased in the last few weeks. For all the reported accidents, they have collected details for each accident and have been maintaining records for the past year and a half (from January 2018 to August 2019).

The city has contracted you to build visualizations that would help them identify patterns in accidents, which would help them take preventive actions to reduce the number of accidents in the future. They would like specific information on certain parameters like borough, time of day, reason for accident, etc.

# Business Problem. Your task is to format the given data and provide visualizations that would answer the specific questions the client has, which are mentioned below.

Analytical Context. You are given a CSV file (stored in the already created data folder) containing details about each accident like date, time, location of the accident, reason for the accident, types of vehicles involved, injury and death count, etc. The delimiter in the given CSV file is ; instead of the default ,. You will be performing the following tasks on the data:

Extract additional borough data stored in a JSON file
Read, transform, and prepare data for visualization
Construct and analyze visualizations of the data to identify patterns in the dataset
The client has a specific set of questions they would like to get answers to. You will need to provide visualizations to accompany these:

How have the number of accidents fluctuated over the past year and a half? Have they increased over that time?
For any particular day, during which hours are accidents most likely to occur?
Are there more accidents on weekdays than weekends?
What are the accidents' count-to-area ratio per borough? Which boroughs have disproportionately large numbers of accidents for their size?
For each borough, during which hours are accidents most likely to occur?
What are the top 5 causes of accidents in the city?
What types of vehicles are most involved in accidents per borough?
What types of vehicles are most involved in deaths?
Note: To solve this extended case, please read the function docstrings very carefully. They contain information that you will need! Also, please don't include print() statements inside your functions (they will most likely produce an error in the test cells). Finally, for the purposes of this case, do not worry about standardizing text variables - for example, treat taxi and Taxi as though they were different values.
